This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error: Argument of type 'string[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'. The program defines a function `greeter` that takes a string as an argument and returns a string. However, when the function is called with an array of strings, a type error occurs. The solution to this problem is to modify the function to accept an array of strings as an argument or to modify the code that calls the function to pass a single string as an argument.
